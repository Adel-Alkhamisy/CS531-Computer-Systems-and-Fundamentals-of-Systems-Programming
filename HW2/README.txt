The address_t structure type that this program constructs has components for each of the four numbers that make up an IPv4 address as well as a fifth component for storing a related alias (key field) that can include up to 10 characters. Address/alias pairs from the "CS531_Inet.txt" file are read into a singly linked list of address_t structures, which will include all of the addresses. The linked list may be unsorted for this exercise.
The user will see the following menu options after creating the linked list:

1) Add address
2) Lookup address
3) Update address
4) Delete address
5) Display list
6) Display aliases for location 
7) Save to file
8) Quit

**Title: Homework 2 in CS531 on Spring 2022 at GMU**
**Introduction/Description:**
Homework 2 is built on by Homework 3.Remember that the datafile "CS531_Inet.txt" contains the contents of our application in HW2? An IPv4 address and alias pair are found on each line of the file "CS531_Inet.txt".

In HW2, program constructed a linked list of address_t structures, each of which contained the four integers of an IPv4 address along with a fifth component in which to store an associated alias of up to 10 characters. The binary search tree (BST) will be used in this software to replace the linked list.

usage:

Click on HW3.c 
- Click on Download raw file, and "CS531_Inet.txt" as well.
- Move the files from the Download folder to a specific folder of your choice i.e. /Users/username/Desktop/HW3.c and /Users/username/Desktop/CS531_Inet.txt ; replace username with your username on your computer.
- Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains the HW2.c and CS531_Inet.txt files. This will depend on your operating system. On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell. On macOS and Linux, you can use Terminal. i.e. cd /path/to/your/directory that contains HW2.c and CS531_Inet.txt
- Compile the C File: Use the gcc command followed by the name of your C file, then -o, and finally the name you want for your output file. The -o option allows you to specify the output file name. i.e. gcc HW2.c -o anyNameOfYourChoice
- then use ./anyNameOfYourChoice
- Then the program will be running and you can test it as you like.
